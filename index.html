                     <h3>What is OSI Model?</h3>
                     <p>The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI) is a framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.In 1983, the CCITT and ISO documents were merged to form The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection, usually referred to as the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, OSI Reference Model, or simply OSI model. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, as standard ISO 7498, and the renamed CCITT (now called the Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union or ITU-T) as standard X.200.</p>

                    <h3>Why OSI Model?</h3>
                    <p class="reasonone">
                        when two computer want to send data we can connect the computer using a lan cable and connectors to transfer data with the help of Network Interface Card.

                        But when two computer with different operating system want to send data, then how can they send data??
                        Here comes the Role of the OSI Model where the data processed over & different layer and then send over network to other devices.

                                    <li>As the name suggests application layer is a layer which works on the application but it does not includes computer applications like Chrome & Firefox, but contains <strong>Protocols </strong> which are needed to make this application works correctly in the network.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Application layer work with the network applications which make use of the net like Chrome, Outlook,Skypee etc.
                                        The netwrok applications like chrome or firefox does not resides in the layer but usees its protocols like <strong>HTTP</strong>and <strong>HTTPs</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Bundle of protocols make the application layer.The data unit is called as <strong>Data or Message</strong>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Following are the activities done at application layer and which protocol they use for it.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>File Transfer uses the <strong>FTP</strong> protocol to transfer the files.</li>
                                    <li>Web Durfing used the <strong>HTTP/S</strong> protocol for web browsing.</li>
                                    <li>Emails are send using the <strong>SMTP</strong> protocols.</li>
                                    <li>Virtual Terminals used <strong>Telnet</strong> protocols.</li>

                                <p>Hence applications protocols are used by the applications to perform user activities.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>The main functioning of the presentation layer is to convert the data received from the application which is in the form of characters and number into the machine friendly language i.e <strong>Binary Code (01).</strong><p>Eg. ASCII -----> EBCDIC
                                        (Convertion of ASCII code into EBCDIC). This is called as <strong>Data Translation.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Then the converted data bits is then reduced which were representing the original data. This bit reduction process is called as <strong>Data Compression.</strong><p>This causes the data to be transfered very quickly.It is useful in real time video and audio streaming. </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To maintain the integrity of the data, the data is <strong>encrypted</strong> at the sender side and then again it is <strong>decrypted</strong> at the receiver side using <strong>SSL Protocol</strong> and other available protocol.
                                    </li>

                                            <p>Eg. Session layer forms a connection with the web server only when the user has logged in with correct username and password.</p>
                                            <p>The main purpose of authentication is security. Without authentication, user's data stored on a server is unsafe on the grounds that everyone can get it from the server.</p>

                                            <p>Error control is done by attaching a CRC before send the data to the physical layer.If any error occurs the receiver sends the acknowledgment for resending the corrupted frames.</p>
